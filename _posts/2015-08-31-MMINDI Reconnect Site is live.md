Welcome to the MMI NDI Reconnect Santa Fe 2016 site. This is where you will find all the information regarding the upcoming 2016, June 24-26 Santa Fe Reunion. David Trujillo, NDI '85, is our site host.

There are several folks behind the scenes who will be involved, and probably don't even know it yet. ;-) But they will be credited as we move forward!

First of all, if you're not already aware - there is a large Facebook Contingent of MMI and NDI alumni on Facebook. Contact us here with your name, class year, school, and facebook/email info so we can connect you to the closed group. We might ask you a stupid question to make sure it's you. ;-)

The original *theme* for this site comes from [the original theme on github](https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean) to be sure we're giving credit to the original author of the framework for this webpage.
