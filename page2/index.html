        <div class="content">
            <p>To be held in Old Town Alexandria, VA/Washington DC, on July 13-17... </p>

<p>Hello Fellow MMI &amp; NDI Classmates (of all years!), </p>

<p>Earlier this year we asked if you were interested in a 2017 Reunion/Birthday Bash (for many turning 50!) – we got a great response of interest. We asked where, when, and a couple other planning questions. We ran with the feedback we got –and then – Nothing. </p>

<p>So, flying with some feedback we did get - we found a Victorian Mansion to possibly host the reunion in; however, we had to let it go without enough commitment (clock was ticking on that reservation).</p>

<p>So we&#39;ve settled on trying for a smaller &#39;hub&#39; house that a few folks can stay in and the rest of us at some nearby hotel(s) that we&#39;re working on block reservations on.</p>

<p>To make this happen we need your donations while we secure the house and we get the rest of the details ironed out (<em>VERY SOON</em> - already <em>IN PROGRESS</em>!)</p>

<p>See our links for Tentative Schedule with Friday Meet &amp; Greet, Saturday Dinner Plans, Sunday BBQ, and last Monday morning hangout! Plenty of things and places to go while we catchup and visit!</p>
