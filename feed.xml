				<title>Announcement MMINDI VA-DC 2017 Reunion/Birthday Event</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;To be held in Old Town Alexandria, VA/Washington DC, on July 13-17... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Fellow MMI &amp;amp; NDI Classmates (of all years!), &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we asked if you were interested in a 2017 Reunion/Birthday Bash (for many turning 50!) – we got a great response of interest. We asked where, when, and a couple other planning questions. We ran with the feedback we got –and then – Nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, flying with some feedback we did get - we found a Victorian Mansion to possibly host the reunion in; however, we had to let it go without enough commitment (clock was ticking on that reservation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;ve settled on trying for a smaller &amp;#39;hub&amp;#39; house that a few folks can stay in and the rest of us at some nearby hotel(s) that we&amp;#39;re working on block reservations on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this happen we need your donations while we secure the house and we get the rest of the details ironed out (&lt;em&gt;VERY SOON&lt;/em&gt; - already &lt;em&gt;IN PROGRESS&lt;/em&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our links for Tentative Schedule with Friday Meet &amp;amp; Greet, Saturday Dinner Plans, Sunday BBQ, and last Monday morning hangout! Plenty of things and places to go while we catchup and visit!&lt;/p&gt;
